                        <a href="#" class="blog-title"> Negative Impact of Technology</a>
                        
                        <p> The negative impact of tech on society involves mass-made products,  with most often blamed: social media. A multitude of research has  been made on the topic where social media is listed as a number one  place with misinformation, hate speech, and harassment on the one  hand, and a place leaving people isolated and depressed on the  other.As the world experiencing many advancements in the technology  it is also facing problems of privacy and security that can strip the world  from personal information. Firstly, privacy issues. Privacy problems are  considered as one of the critical issues. Privacy issues are concerned  with tracking locations and spying on information. Society has become  excessively dependent on technology which has resulted in reduced  physical activity due to people spending a considerable amount of time  on computers. The days before technology daily life involved a huge amount of  physical activity which today leaves no time for exercise. It can be  argued the use of technology affects our mind and makes people lazy.  In society today many people do not endeavor to educate themselves  and use their own knowledge as they resort to technology There are  many negative effects of technology which will effects people’s daily  life such as language proficiency, social life and health. Through the  critical readings of research materials done it can be concluded that the  misuse of technology has made society to become uncompassionate  and self-centered. </p>
                             <p>Each step forward in technology brings about a process of creative destruction, where  new innovations can have negative effects on existing ones. For example, the advent of  television can adversely affect the movie industry, and the introduction of synthetic fibers  may impact the production of cotton. The implementation of new technologies can also  have detrimental effects on the economy, with television potentially consuming all  available productive hours. Furthermore, every emerging technology carries  unforeseeable long-term consequences. For instance, the creation of weapons like  bombs, nuclear weapons, and missiles for security purposes raises questions about their  ethical justification. Science and technology play a substantial role in shaping society,  influencing communication, work, housing, clothing, food, transportation, and even the  length and quality of life. These advancements lead to shifts in moral values and  fundamental philosophies. Technology has both advantages and disadvantages, but we  should have some knowledge about how to use it in a proper way so that we can get  benefits from it without any bad impacts. </p>
