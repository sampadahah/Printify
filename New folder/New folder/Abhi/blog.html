Technology is the  application of this knowledge for practical ends. Technologies change  all the time individually, and in their aggregate, typically in a sequence  of replacements of older by newer tech. Their purpose is either to  enhance human capabilities or to enable humans to perform tasks they  could not perform otherwise Technology is human knowledge which  involves tools, materials, and systems. The application of technology  typically results in products. If technology is well applied, it benefits  humans, but the opposite is unfortunately true, when technology is  </p>

                        <p> The negative impact of tech on society involves mass-made products,  with most often blamed: social media. A multitude of research has  been made on the topic where social media is listed as a number one  place with misinformation, hate speech, and harassment on the one  hand, and a place leaving people isolated and depressed on the  other.As the world experiencing many advancements in the technology  it is also facing problems of privacy and security that can strip the world  from personal information. Firstly, privacy issues. Privacy problems are  considered as one of the critical issues. Privacy issues are concerned  with tracking locations and spying on information. Society has become  excessively dependent on technology which has resulted in reduced  physical activity due to people spending a considerable amount of time  on computers.

Through the  critical readings of research materials done it can be concluded that the  misuse of technology has made society to become uncompassionate  and self-centered.
