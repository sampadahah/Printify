                        <a href="#" class="blog-title"> Introduction to 
                            Technology</a>
                        <p> Technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and  use of technical means and their interrelation with life, society, and the  environment, drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts,  engineering, applied science, and pure science. Technology is the  application of this knowledge for practical ends. Technologies change  all the time individually, and in their aggregate, typically in a sequence  of replacements of older by newer tech. Their purpose is either to  enhance human capabilities or to enable humans to perform tasks they  could not perform otherwise Technology is human knowledge which  involves tools, materials, and systems. The application of technology  typically results in products. If technology is well applied, it benefits  humans, but the opposite is unfortunately true, when technology is  used for malicious reasons. </p>
                        <p>Technology is always connected with obtaining certain results, resolving certain  problems, completing certain tasks using skills, employing knowledge and exploiting  assets. The concept of technology does not only relate to the technology that it  embodies in the product, but it is also associated with the knowledge or information of  its use, application and the process in developing the product. Technology as the  intangible assets of the firm is rooted in the routines and is not easy to transfer due to  the gradual learning process and higher cost associated with transferring tacit  knowledge. Valuable technological knowledge which is the intangible assets of the firm  is never easily transferred from one firm to another because the technological learning  process is needed to assimilate and internalize the transferred technology. Technology  is all around us, affecting how we work and spend our free time. It holds information that  some might not like, but it also has both good and bad effects on our minds. Even if you  don't own a computer or credit card, information about almost everything is stored on a  computer somewhere. The new technology is starting to impact the minds of young kids  and teens in ways that might not be good, influencing our future. It also allows people to  share information that they couldn't before. Furthermore, technology is a major force  shaping the future, changing our lives rapidly. It has big effects on how safe, healthy,  and happy people feel. Throughout history, people have always looked for better ways  to meet their needs, and technology has improved how we eat, dress, and find shelter.  It also changes everyday things like healthcare, education, work satisfaction, and  leisure activities. </p>
