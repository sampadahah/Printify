Human societies and technology have grown inextricably linked since  technical systems like mobile phones, computers, TV, etc. are produced  by humans and reflect the very basis of a population’s needs and  lifestyle. Although technology improves the lifestyle of human beings, it  is also a major concern for future generations. Nowadays, people are  excessively using technology which reduces their physical activities and  directly affects their health. Technology has a more positive impact on  humans or society as compared to negative. It makes our life easier and  reward us by providing resources or tool that make our life much  easier.</p>
                        <p>There are significant improvements to various aspects of our lives through technology.  The entertainment industry has undergone a transformation thanks to technology. We  now enjoy a plethora of options, from creating extensive playlists on our iPods to watching  movies on the go. The possibilities seem boundless. Modern technologies have played a  pivotal role in job creation and the establishment of tech running companies. With just a  computer and internet access, anyone can initiate a home-based business. Successful  companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Facebook began as ventures from homes and  now employ large workforces. The internet facilitates access to the latest news from any  corner of the world. Platforms like Twitter empower individuals to act as instant journalists, 
                            reporting news in real-time. Websites like Wikipedia offer a wealth of information,  although it may not always be entirely accurate. Connecting with both old and new friends  has become incredibly straightforward. Social networks like Facebook and Twitter allow  us to effortlessly keep up with old friends and make new connections. Electronic media,  encompassing radio, television, the internet, and social media, has elevated the  exchange of ideas, contributing to societal development. Communication technologies  such as telephones, video conferencing, email, and instant messengers enable nearly  instantaneous information flow within organizations and businesses. Technology has  transformed education through the integration of educational video games and puzzles,  sparking students' interest in learning. Many schools provide free internet access,  enabling students to conduct independent research. Online education has made  educational materials accessible anywhere, breaking down institutional barriers and  providing students from developing countries with opportunities like those in first-world  education institutions. This expanded access enhances their prospects for employment  on an international scale.</p>
